        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
          <li>The !DOCTYPE html declaration is letting the browser know to expect HTML on the page.</li>
          <li>The html opening tag represents the root, or start, of our HTML document</li>
          <li>The attribute of lang="en", tells the browser the language for the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>An external CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>We can use the * selector when we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page.</li>
          <li>We can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained.</li>
          <li>When we create an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file in order for the styles to be dsiplayed on the application page.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>A variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>To declare a variable, we use the 'var' keyword.</li>
          <li>A string is contained within quotation marks.</li>
          <li>We use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>

          <li>Each line of JavaScript code ends with a semicolon.</li>
